7202016	39087409	########	32440555	Frank	Kelly has a great room in a very central location. 
Beautiful building , architecture and a style that we really like. 
We felt guite at home here and wish we had spent more time.
Went for a walk and found Seattle Center with a major food festival in progress. What a treat.
Visited the Space Needle and the Chihuly Glass exhibit. Then Pikes Place Market. WOW.  Thanks for a great stay.

Didn't really get to meet Kelly until I was on my out, but she was always readily available by phone. 
I believe the only "issue" (if you want to call it that) was finding a place to park, but I sincerely doubt its easy to park anywhere in a residential area after 5 pm on a Friday

Easy to find and Kelly was warm, welcoming, and really interesting to talk to. 
7202016	41986501	########	34959538	Ming	Kelly was a great host and very accommodating in a great neighborhood. She has some great coffee and while I wasn't around much during my stay the time I spent interacting with her was very pleasant. 
The apartment is in a great location and very close to the Seattle Center. The neighborhood itself has a lot of good food as well!
7202016	43979139	########	1154501	Barent	Kelly was great, place was great, just what I was looking for-
clean, simple, well kept place.
5 min walk to the Seattle bike share (as of Aug 2015) which I used all week.
7202016	45265631	9/1/2015	37853266	Kevin	Kelly was great! Very nice and the neighborhood and place to stay was expected and comfortable. Overall great and would book again.

CHEERS
7202016	47783346	########	249583	Todd	Kelly's place is conveniently located on a quiet street in Lower Queen Anne which is an easy walk or bus/cab ride to Belltown and Downtown in addition to being a booming neighborhood in its own right.
